# 🪀 Jell-Kkagi

**Jell-Kkagi** is a pseudo-3D mini game built with Pygame. It features **3D perspective projection**, **soft-body physics** and an AI opponent trained using **reinforcement learning(RL)**.

## 🧠 Features

- 🧩 **Pseudo 3D Visualization**: 2D rendering of a 3D world using custom perspective projection
- 🫧 **Soft-body Simulation**: Jelly-like flexible object with physics-based deformation and collisions
- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning AI**: Q-learning based intelligent opponent
- 🎮 **User Interface**: Intuitive mouse-controlled gameplay using Pygame
